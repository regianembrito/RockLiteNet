## A little about me.
I have been working as a developer since 2009. Itâ€™s a long time..<br /><br />

I have ever program in Python, PHP (Zend Framework, Codeigniter, Cake Php), .Net, .Net Core and a little bit Java. <br />
I have never program in React.js before this challenge. I liked a lot to learn about it. I hope to be a part of the Rock Content team, but I want to thank you for the opportunity to learn it - I expend the last 4 days in it.<br />
Although my 11 years programming, I have never started a project in .Net from its beginning. Then I have some considerations:

## Security:
For the security, I would configure STS in the .Net API.

## Scalability:
For the scalability, I would consider to use Lambda AWS for the PUT method of .Net API.

## But at first:
But, at first off all, I would consult another developers in Rock Content to know the best practices adopted by the Company. I really believe in the exchange of knowledge. 

## Finaly
I hope to have the opportunity to grow up whit Rock Content team. 

## Thanks for today.
